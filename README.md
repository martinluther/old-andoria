# ANDORIA | MLC's Admissions Application Application #

Don't ask about the name, I know it doesn't make sense.

## Purpose Statement ##

Andoria is the online web application written specifically to handle admission applications for Martin Luther College. It will start as an undergraduate-only piece of software, but the future will hopefully bring more functionality and handle all manner of applications for different departments at the school.

### Technology ###

* Rails 3.0.x
* SQLite 3.x*
* PostgreSQL 8.x
* Ruby 1.9.x

SQLite is to be used only as a persistence layer for applications not submitted. The idea is to give applicants the ability to begin an application, quit, and then come back later to finish it.

### Application Parts ###

This is by no means an exhaustive list.
